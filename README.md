# Darkan Game Server
Darkan is a 2012 pre-EOC remake of RuneScape using 727. It was originally created from a fresh de-obfuscation of the 727 client, a fresh 727 cache and the matrix base. The code source is currently being updated and re-factored to allow contributors to append to source code while keeping the integrity of the game. For this reason the lobby server will not be posted on github. This way people do not leech or edit player files.
