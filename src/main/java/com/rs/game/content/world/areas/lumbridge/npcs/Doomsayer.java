//TODO add toggle warnings handler

//Correct Behaviour
//Doomsayer: If you see the signs often enough, then you can turn them of; by that time you likely known what the area has in store for you.
//Player: But what If I want to see the warnings again?
//Doomsayer: That's why I'm waiting here!
//Doomsayer: If you want to see the warning messages again, I can turn them back on for you.
//Doomsayer: Do you need to turn on any warnings right now?
//Player: Yes, I do.
//Screen opens
//Player: Not right now.
//Doomsayer: Ok, keep an eye out for the messages though!
//Player: I will.
