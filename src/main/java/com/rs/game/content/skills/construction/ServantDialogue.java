			"Oh! Please hire me sir! I'm very good - well, I'm not bad- and my fee's only 750 coins.",
			"You're not aristocracy, but I suppose you'd do. Do you want a good cook for 2250 coins?",
			"Good day, sir! Would sir care to hire a good butler for 3750 coins?",

			"Well, I can, um. I can cook meals and make tea and everything, and I can even take things to and from the bank for you. I won't make any mistakes this time and everything will be fine!",
			"I, sir, am the finest cook in all Arrow! I can also make good time going to the bank or sawmill.",
			"I can fulfill sir's domestic service needs with efficiency and impeccable manners. I hate to boast, but I can say with confidence that no mortal can make trips to the bank or sawmill fast than I!",

			"Well, city warder Bravek once threw a chair at me and yelled at me to get him a hangover cure. So I made it and I think it worked, 'cause then he threw another chair at me and that one hit!",
			"Oh! Oh! I, well I er. It wasn't really my fault, I mean, it was, but not really. I mean, how was I to know that that plate was so valuable? It was just lying around and I don't know art, it just looked like a pretty pattern.",
			"I used to be the cook for the old Duke of Lumbridge. Visiting dignataries praised me for my fine banquets! But then someone found a rule that only one family could hold that post. Overnight, I was fired for someone who couldn't even bake cakes without burning them!",
			"From a humble beginning as a dish-washer I have worked my way up through the ranks of domestic service in the households of nobles from Varrock and Ardougne. As a life-long servant I have naturally suppressed my personality.",
			"For millennia I have served and waited on the mighty Demon Lords of the infernal Dimensions. I began as a humble footman in the household of Lord Thammaron. Currently, I come to serve the mortal masters in the realms of light.",
