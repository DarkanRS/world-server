//
//	"What is this place?"
//	"A good question; straight and to the point."
//	"My name is Matthias, I am a falconer, and this is where I train my birds."
//		"Do you have any quests I could do?"
//			"A quest? What a strange notion. Do you normally go"
//			"around asking complete strangers for quests?"
//			"Er, yes, now you come to mention it."
//			"Oh, ok then. Well, no, I don't; sorry."
//		"That sounds like fun; could I have a go?"
//
//		"That doesn't sound like my sort of thing."
//			"Fair enough; it does require a great deal of patience and "
//			"skill, so I can understand if you might feel intimidated."
//		"What's this falconry thing all about then?"
//			"Well, some people see it as a sport, although such a term"
//			"does not really convey the amount of patience and"
//			"dedication required to be proficient at the task."
//
//			"Putting it simply, it is the training and use of birds of prey in hunting quarry."
//
//
//	"Sorry, you really need both hands free for falconry. I'd"
//	" suggest that you put away your weapons and gloves before we start."
//
//	Pay 500 coins.
//		"The falconer gives you a large leather glove and brings one of the smaller"
//		"birds over to land on it."
//
//		"Don't worry; I'll keep an eye on you to make sure you "
//		"don't upset it too much."
//	Not right now.
//
//
//// "You should speak to Matthias to get this removed safely.
//"Hello again."
//"Ah, you're back. How are you getting along with her then?"
//"It's certainly harder than it looks."
//"Sorry, but I was talking to the falcon, not you. But yes it "
//"is. Have you had enough yet?"
//	"Actually, I'd like to keep trying a little longer."
//		"Ok then, just come talk to me when you're done."
//	"I think I'll leave it for now."
//		"You give the falcon and glove back to Matthias."
//
//"It'll cost you 500 coins to borrow one of my birds."
